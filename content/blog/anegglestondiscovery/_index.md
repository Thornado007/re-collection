While browsing the Eggleston archive on MoMA’s website, I came across an image that genuinely surprised me. What immediately stood out was the movement in the leaves of the tree and the blades of grass. This blur suggests a longer shutter speed, which in turn implies the use of a tripod. And the tripod implies deliberation: choosing where to place it, how to frame the scene, and when to release the shutter. In other words, this was not a quick snapshot. That realization unsettled my usual expectations of an Eggleston photograph.

Typically, I associate Eggleston’s work with a particular kind of immediacy—images that feel instinctive, almost impulsive, yet somehow perfectly resolved. His photographs often appear casually taken, but they carry an underlying compositional complexity that resists that assumption. This tension between apparent spontaneity and careful, unconventional structure is central to how I experience his work. In that sense, this image feels like an anomaly.

When looking at photographs by artists I admire, I often imagine the conditions under which the image was made. I think about where the photographer stood, how long they lingered, and how much conscious thought went into the act of photographing. With Eggleston, I almost always imagine speed: a quick glance, a decisive moment, an intuitive response rather than prolonged consideration. His photographs feel driven by instinct and feeling more than by explicit calculation.
This perception is reinforced by William Eggleston in the Real World, the underrated documentary in which he is seen wandering through his neighbourhood, photographing as he moves. He walks, snap. Gets out of the car, snap. Later, when he began using a tripod for commissioned projects, the resulting images still retained that distinctive tension. I think this is partly because they lack visible movement blur and maintain a strange, unresolved compositional logic.

Before watching the documentary, I was worried that witnessing his process might demystify the work—like seeing a magic trick exposed as a banal technical manoeuvre. But in true Eggleston fashion, the opposite happened. Observing him photograph revealed very little. He spoke rarely, and almost never about the images themselves. Rather than clarifying his intentions, the experience deepened the enigma. The photographs remained mysterious because the man behind them was equally opaque.
There is a sense, when looking at many of Eggleston’s images, that they could not exist in any other form. The photograph is exactly as it needs to be—no alternatives, no variations. Like two magnets drawn together, the camera and the scene simply meet. I often think of Eggleston’s relationship to his subjects in this way: inevitable rather than constructed.

This particular image, however, does not produce the same tension for me. It feels more controlled, more frontal, almost restrained. In that sense, it recalls the typological rigor of German photography, such as the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher. It even shares the same grey, overcast background and straight-on composition the Bechers were known for.
Here, time becomes perceptible through the blur of movement in the leaves. The presence of the tripod is felt. The photograph acknowledges duration rather than denying it.

I find myself wondering whether this shift makes me value the image less. I don’t think it does. Rather, it situates the photograph differently within Eggleston’s practice. It is refreshing to encounter an image that so clearly registers the passage of time, one in which duration is not concealed but allowed to surface. This, in turn, opens up another way of thinking about Eggleston’s working method—not as a continuous stream of instantaneous, intuitive decisions, but as a practice that can also accommodate waiting, patience, and temporal awareness. Perhaps seeing democratically—Eggleston’s term for refusing hierarchies within subject matter or composition—also means accepting that this openness occasionally results in images that are more direct, more frontal, even seemingly straightforward.
