This website is an ongoing exercise in curation, documentation, and digital preservation. It serves as a personal repository for my lifelong obsession with collecting and scanning — primarily images, but also objects that interest me like vintage t-shirts or crystals.

## The Purpose

For as long as I can remember, I've been compelled to collect, organize, and catalog. This digital space represents the convergence of several passions:

- **Archiving** as a practice of memory and preservation
- **Photography** as a means of documentation and expression  
- **Cataloging** as an exercise in finding meaning through organization
- **Web design** as a medium for sharing these collections

## The Process

Each collection here represents a different facet of this ongoing project:

1. **Digital Preservation** - Scanning and digitizing analog materials (35mm film, prints, documents)
2. **Curation** - Selecting, sequencing, and contextualizing images
3. **Organization** - Developing systems for categorization and retrieval
4. **Presentation** - Creating interfaces that honor both the material and the viewer


## Technical Notes

This site is built using:
- **Hugo** - Static site generator for performance and simplicity
- **Blowfish Theme** - Clean, minimal design foundation
- **Custom HTML/CSS** - For specific presentation needs
- **Digital Asset Management** - Organized file structures and metadata

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Accessibility** - Collections should be viewable and navigable
- **Context** - Images gain meaning through arrangement and description
- **Openness** - Sharing work invites conversation and connection

## Contact & Collaboration

This is a personal project, but I'm always interested in:
- Technical discussions about archiving and digitization
- Collaborative documentation projects
- Feedback on presentation and organization
- Sharing resources and methodologies

For inquiries, suggestions, or just to share your own archival projects, please reach out.
